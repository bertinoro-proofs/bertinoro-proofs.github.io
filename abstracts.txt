How to be convinced by a conversation while barely listening (even to yourself)	

The celebrated PCP Theorem states that any language in NP can be decided via a verifier that reads O(1) bits from a polynomially long proof. Interactive oracle proofs (IOP), a generalization of PCPs, allow the verifier to interact with the prover for multiple rounds while reading a small number of bits from each prover message. While PCPs are relatively well understood, the power captured by IOPs (beyond NP) has yet to be fully explored.

We present a generalization of the PCP theorem for interactive languages. We show that any language decidable by a k-round IP has a k-round public-coin IOP, where the verifier makes its decision by reading only O(k/log n) bits from the interaction transcript. Furthermore, for a natural class of k-round interactive proofs that are ""interactively reducible,"" we show a k-round public-coin IOP in which the verifier reads a constant number of bits from the transcript. This class contains the k-variate sumcheck protocol and, for k=poly(n), contains Shamir's protocol for PSPACE, thereby showing variants of these protocols in which the verifier has a constant bit-query complexity.

As a corollary of these results, we show IOP-to-IOP transformations that previously were known to hold only for IPs, and get a new hardness of approximation result for stochastic constraint satisfaction problems.

Lower Bound on SNARGs in the Random Oracle Model	

Succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) have become a fundamental primitive in the cryptographic community. The focus of this work is constructions of SNARGs in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). Such SNARGs enjoy post-quantum security and can be deployed using lightweight cryptography to instantiate the random oracle heuristically. A ROM-SNARG is \emph{(t,Œµ)-sound} if no t-query malicious prover can convince the verifier to accept a false statement with a probability larger than Œµ. Recently, Chiesa-Yogev (CRYPTO '21) presented a ROM-SNARG of length Œò(log(t/Œµ)‚ãÖlog t) (ignoring log n factors, for n being the instance size). This improvement, however, is still far from the (folklore) lower bound of Œ©(log(t/Œµ)).

Assuming the \textit{randomized exponential-time hypothesis}, we prove a tight lower bound of Œ©(log(t/Œµ)‚ãÖlog t) for the length of {(t,Œµ)-sound} ROM-SNARGs. Our lower bound holds for constructions with non-adaptive verifiers and strong soundness notion called \textit{salted soundness}, restrictions that hold for \emph{all} known constructions (ignoring contrived counterexamples). We prove our lower bound by transforming any short ROM-SNARG (of the considered family) into the same length ROM-SNARG in which the verifier asks only a \emph{few} oracles queries, and then apply the recent lower bound of Chiesa-Yogev (TCC '20) for such SNARGs.

PCPs, LTCs, and high dim expanders	

High dimensional expanders are a relatively recent generalization of expander graphs. 
These objects might be related to probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs), but are they? 

A possible indication in this direction is a recent new construction of locally testable codes with optimal parameters (constant rate distance and locality) that is based on certain high dim expanders.

I will give an introduction to high dimensional expanders, survey some known results, and discuss some open directions of research.

Compact Certificates of Collective Knowledge	

We introduce compact certificate schemes, which allow any party to take a large number of signatures on a message M, by many signers of different weights, and compress them to a much shorter certificate. This certificate convinces the verifiers that signers with sufficient total weight signed M, even though the verifier will not see--let alone verify--all of the signatures. Thus, for example, a compact certificate can be used to prove that parties who jointly have a sufficient total account balance have
attested to a given block in a blockchain.

More generally, compact certificates can be used to prove that multiple parties together possess sufficiently weighty witnesses to a number of NP statements.

After defining compact certificates, we demonstrate an efficient compact certificate scheme. We then show how to implement such a scheme in a decentralized setting over an unreliable network and in the presence of adversarial parties who wish to disrupt certificate creation.

Your Reputation's Safe with Me: Framing-Free Distributed Zero-Knowledge Proofs	

Distributed Zero-Knowledge (dZK) proofs allow a prover to prove statements of the form ""x is in L"" for an NP language L to a set of verifiers, without revealing anything except the validity of the statement. Interestingly, this can be done even when x is distributed between the verifiers, and no verifier knows the entire x. dZK proofs are useful building blocks in designing secure cryptographic protocols. However, existing dZK proofs suffer from a severe limitation: corrupted verifiers can ""frame"" an honest prover, causing verification of a true claim to fail. In this talk I will present a novel construction of ""framing-free"" dZK proofs in which honest provers cannot be framed.

Highly-efficient Interactive Oracle Proofs & Cryptographic Applications	

Interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) extend the classic notion of probabilistically-checkable proofs (PCPs) by allowing a verifier to interact with a prover over a small number of rounds, while querying the prover‚Äôs messages in only a few locations.

A recent line of work gave highly-efficient IOPs bypassing state-of-the-art PCPs, for example, constant-round and constant-query IOPs with only a linear (and even approaching the witness length) amount of communication, as well as IOPs with linear-time prover complexity. These constructions were leveraged in turn to obtain highly-efficient succinct arguments and zero-knowledge proofs.

The improved efficiency was obtained by replacing polynomial-based codes, commonly used in such proof systems, with more efficient (tensor-based) codes. In particular, these constructions bypassed a barrier imposed by the need to encode the computation using a multiplication code.

In the talk I will survey these highly-efficient IOP constructions, and their cryptographic applications.

Fiat-Shamir and SNARGs for Sum-Check

The Fiat-Shamir heuristic converts interactive proofs/arguments into non-interactive arguments. In particular, starting with a succinct proof, Fiat-Shamir yields succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs), which find applications in cryptocurrencies. However, despite being provably secure in the random oracle model, the Fiat-Shamir paradigm is known to be insecure with respect to any explicit hash function, at least for a particular interactive argument. The question is then which interactive proofs and hash functions can Fiat-Shamir be proven secure for.

In this talk, we apply Fiat-Shamir paradigm to the sum-check protocol with a hash function by Peikert and Shiehian (CRYPTO 2019) and prove its soundness, thereby obtaining SNARGs from sub-exponential LWE.

Verifying the Unseen - interactive proofs for label invariant distribution properties

Given i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution over a large domain [ùëÅ ], approximating several basic quantities, including the distribution‚Äôs support size, its entropy, and its distance from the uniform distribution, requires Œò (ùëÅ /log ùëÅ ) samples [Valiant and Valiant, STOC 2011].
Suppose, however, that we can interact with a powerful but untrusted prover, who knows the entire distribution (or a good approximation of it). Can we use such a prover to approximate (or rather, to approximately verify) such statistical quantities more efficiently? We show that this is indeed the case: the support size, the entropy, and the distance from the uniform distribution, can all be approximately verified via a 2-message interactive proof, where the communication complexity, the verifier‚Äôs running time, and the sample complexity are ùëÇ(\sqrt(N)) . For all these quantities, the sample
complexity is tight up to polylogùëÅ factors (for any interactive proof, regardless of its communication complexity or verification time).
More generally, we give a tolerant interactive proof system with the above sample and communication complexities for verifying a distribution‚Äôs proximity to any label-invariant property (any property that is invariant to re-labeling of the elements in the distribution‚Äôs support). The verifier‚Äôs running time in this more general protocol is also O(\sqrt(N)) under a mild assumption about the complexity of deciding, given a compact representation of a distribution, whether it is in the property or far from it.
